Experience #0: 
Specific Task: find two toiletpaper and put them in cabinet.
Your Actions:I go to and open cabinet(1-4), go to toiletpaperhanger 1, go to towelholder 1.
Result: False
Reflection: I met Operation Failure. I tried to take toiletpaper from cabinets 1-3, but nothing happened. This is because there is no toiletpaper in these cabinets. I should not take items from containers that do not have the target item. In the next trial, I should continue searching for the toiletpaper in other possible locations, such as drawers or shelves.

Your Actions: I go to drawer(1-5), go to shelf(1-7).
Result: False

1. If I met Operation Failure, trying to take items from a container, I should verify that this container indeed contains this item. f it does not, I should continue searching in other locations.
2. If I met Search Failure, I should review the places I have already searched and consider going to an unsearched location next to continue my search.
