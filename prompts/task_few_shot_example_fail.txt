Exemplars #1

***Input***

Experience #0: 
Task: find two toiletpaper and put them in cabinet.
Reflection: I met Operation Failure. I tried to take toiletpaper from cabinets 1-3, but nothing happened. This is because there is no toiletpaper in these cabinets. I should not take items from containers that do not have the target item. In the next trial, I should continue searching for the toiletpaper in other possible locations, such as drawers or shelves.
Experience #1: 
Task: find two soapbar and put them in safe.
Reflection: I met Search Failure. In this trial, I checked all drawers and shelves but did not find the soapbar. In the next trial, I should continue searching for the soapbars, starting with a different location like the cabinet or dresser.

***Summary Result***

1. If I plan to take an item from a container, I should verify that this container indeed contains this item. If it does not, I should continue searching in other locations.
2. If I can not find an item, I should review locations already searched to avoid repeated searches,  then plan the next search location.

Exemplars #2

***Input***

Experience #0: 
Task: put some vase on safe.
Reflection: I met Search Failure. I spent too much time checking empty cabinets and drawers without finding a vase. I should have focused on locations where a vase is more likely to be found, such as shelves or sidetables. Additionally, I should have moved on to the next location if the current one was empty, instead of repeatedly checking the same locations. I will prioritize checking locations with higher chances of containing the item I need in the future
Experience #1: 
Task: put a soapbar on cabinet.
Reflection: I met Plan Failure. In this trial, I make a mistake of taking soapbottle instead of soapbar. I should double-check the items I pick up to ensure they match the required items for the task.
Past Summary:
1. If I plan to take an item from a container, I should verify that this container indeed contains this item. If it does not, I should continue searching in other locations.
