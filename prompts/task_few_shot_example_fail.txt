Exemplars #1

***Input***

Experience #0: 
Task: find two toiletpaper and put them in cabinet.
Reflection: I met Operation Failure. I tried to take toiletpaper from cabinet (1-3), but nothing happened. This is because there is no toiletpaper in these cabinets. I should not take items from containers that do not have the target item. In the next trial, I should continue searching for the toiletpaper in other possible locations.
Experience #1: 
Task: find two soapbar and put them in safe.
Reflection: I met Search Failure. In this trial, I checked drawer (1-6) and desk (1-2) but did not find the soapbar. In the next trial, I should continue to find soapbar, starting with a different location, like shelf 1.

***Summary Result***

1. Before I take an item from a container, I should verify that this container indeed contains this item. 
2. If I can not find an item, I should continue searching in locations I haven't checked yet to avoid duplicate searching.
